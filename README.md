# Discussions

In most repositories we want the issue to be actionable: a contributor should be able to come in, pick an issue, and do some work in order to close it.

This repository is for all the _other_ discussions, the ones where we need to inform everyone involved in the project about something, or figure out a policy about something, or make a decision of some sort. This is the repository for philosophical discussions, for asking clarifying questions, for discussing priorities.

The actual discussions can be found in the [issues](https://github.com/Kiluth/discussions/issues) section.
